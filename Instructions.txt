# ANYCUBIC RESIN EXPOSURE FINDER by X3msnake
---------------------------------------------
Download and unzip the 'resin-xp-finder' folder to a USB stick

### SETUP ###
- Make sure your machine is levelled before running the test
- Insert and fix the vat and build platform
- Load the vat with the resin you want to test

### ENABLE MACHINE TEST MODE ###
- Run 'test-mode.gcode' (one of the files in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder)

### TEST YOUR RESIN ###
There are 2 initial resin test files that work for most resins
'resin-test-25u.B100.2-20.photon'
'resin-test-50u.B100.2-20.photon'

25u/50u  - Layer height: 25/50 microns
B100 - Base Layer exposure time: 100 sec
2-20 - Exposure range time: 2 to 20 sec

I recommend running 'resin-test-50u.B100.2-20.photon' first.

You may also run the 25 micron layer height test file ('resin-test-25u.B100.2-20.photon') to know the results of your resin for thinner layers. 

If you know your resin is a slow curing one you should use the test files inside the 'slow_resin_tests' folder instead.

### CLEAN AND CURE FILM ###
At the end of the test:
- Remove the build platform
- Rinse gently but thoroughly with the appropriate solvent (usually isopropyl alcohol)
- UV Post-cure the test print for 15 minutes
- After curing gently peel off the test print from the build platform

### MAKING SENSE OF THE RESULTS ###
- Resin underexposure: the small lines and details are missing 
- Resin minimum exposure: the first column were the cured graphics begin to show 
- Resin sweet-spot: the first column where you can see most of the details (the one just before the negative spaces start to get filled in)
- Resin overexposure: colunmns where the negative space gets filled in
- To know what exposure time each column represents, multiply the column number by 2 (C1 = 2sec, C2 = 4sec,... C10 = 20 sec)

- If using the slow curing resin files, multiply the column number by the first value of the exposure range:
'resin-test-25u.B150.6-60.photon': C1 = 6sec, C2 = 12sec,... C10 = 60 sec
'resin-test-25u.B150.10-100.photon': C1 = 10sec, C2 = 20sec,... C10 = 100 sec
'resin-test-25u.B150.20-200.photon': C1 = 20sec, C2 = 40sec,... C10 = 200 sec

### RETURN YOUR MACHINE TO PRINT MODE ###
- Run 'print-mode.gcode' (also in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder), dial in your sweet exposure time on a test piece and enjoy the magic!
